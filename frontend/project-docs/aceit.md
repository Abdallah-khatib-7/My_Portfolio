## About

I built AceIt because there was no single platform that combined honest CV analysis, live AI interview practice, skill testing, and a personalized improvement plan in one place. So I built it myself — from the database schema to the deployment pipeline.

AceIt is not a generic interview tool. It was designed around the real job-seeking workflow of a developer — from uploading your CV and getting brutally honest ATS feedback, to going through a full mock interview session with an AI that never repeats a question, to tracking your progress over time with detailed reports and a personal roadmap that updates automatically after every session.

Built by Abdallah Khatib — a Computer Science graduate from Lebanese International University, and the developer behind PharmaCare and Tawla (SaaS restaurant POS).

## ✨ Key Features

### 📄 CV Review
- Upload your CV as a PDF — extracted and analyzed entirely server-side
- AI scores your CV out of 100 exactly like a real ATS system
- Full breakdown: formatting score, content score, keyword score
- Identifies missing keywords, specific weaknesses, and actionable improvements
- Every weakness auto-generates a roadmap item
- Past reviews are saved and fully accessible with one click
- CV stored securely on AWS S3 with pre-signed URL access

### 🧠 AI Interview
- Choose your major, job title, experience level, and years of experience
- AI generates 7 tailored questions — technical, behavioral, and situational
- Strict no-repeat logic — every asked question is passed back to the AI so it never generates the same question twice in a session
- Each answer is scored out of 10 with specific feedback and the ideal answer revealed
- Progress bar tracks questions answered in real time
- Full report at the end: overall score, hire recommendation, top strengths, areas to improve, recommended resources
- Past sessions are saved, clickable, and show the full reconstructed report

### ⚡ Skill Quizzes
- AI generates multiple choice quizzes tailored to your exact job title and tech stack
- Choose between 5, 10, 15, or 20 questions
- Answer one question at a time with a clean radio-button UI
- After submission: full breakdown of every question — your answer, correct answer, right or wrong
- Wrong answers automatically generate roadmap improvement items
- Past quizzes saved and fully clickable to review the breakdown

### 🗺️ Roadmap
- Auto-populated from every CV review, interview session, and quiz you complete
- Items sorted by priority: high → medium → low
- Filter by status (all / pending / done) and by type (CV / interview / quiz)
- Mark items done with one click — strikethrough animation, re-clickable to undo
- Delete items you no longer need
- Progress bar shows overall completion percentage with live stats per priority level

### 📊 Reports
- Full performance dashboard across all three features
- Overall score card combining CV, interview, and quiz averages with animated score bars
- Separate tabs for Interviews, CV Reviews, and Quizzes — each with a summary banner and full session list
- Every session row shows a mini score bar and is clickable
- Recent activity feed across all feature types
- Pro users can export a professional PDF report with full stats, session history, and recent activity

### 💳 Subscription Plans
- Three tiers enforced at the API level — not just in the UI
- Free tier: 1 CV review, 1 interview, 3 quizzes
- Basic ($9.99/month): 5 CV reviews, 5 interviews, 20 quizzes, full reports

- Upgrade flow includes a full mock payment UI: animated card preview, card number formatter, expiry formatter, 2-second processing simulation, success screen
- Cancel subscription from settings — instantly returns user to free plan

### ⚙️ Settings
- **Profile tab** — change name, email, choose avatar from 12 icons (like Duolingo)

## 💡 Key Business Logic

| Feature | Logic |
|---|---|
| No-repeat questions | Every question asked in a session is passed back to the AI on the next call — it is physically impossible for the AI to repeat a question |
| Free tier enforcement | Usage is tracked per user per feature in the database — limits are checked in the controller before any AI call is made |
| CV extraction | PDF is uploaded to memory (never written to disk), text is extracted server-side with pdf2json, then sent to OpenAI |
| S3 access | Bucket is fully private — files are only accessible via pre-signed URLs with a 1-hour expiry |
| Roadmap auto-generation | Every CV weakness, every interview area to improve, and every wrong quiz answer automatically creates a roadmap item |
| Password policy | New password must differ from current password — enforced at the API level, not just the UI |
| Subscription enforcement | Plan limits are checked at the controller level — a Pro user who downgrades cannot bypass limits by calling the API directly |
| Avatar persistence | Avatar selection is saved to the database and returned on every `/api/auth/me` call — persists across sessions |

---

## 🔒 Security

- JWT authentication on every protected route — no exceptions
- bcrypt password hashing with 10 salt rounds
- Rate limiting: 10 login attempts per 15 minutes, 500 API calls per 15 minutes
- AWS S3 private bucket — zero public access, pre-signed URLs expire after 1 hour
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries on every single database call
- Global error handler — never exposes stack traces, SQL errors, or internal details in production
- CORS restricted to frontend origin only
- Helmet.js security headers on all responses
- `.env` never committed — enforced via `.gitignore`
- 3-step account deletion with password re-confirmation

## Deployment

- **Frontend (Live):** https://ace-it-eight.vercel.app

- **Database:** Aiven MySQL (eu-north-1)
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 (eu-north-1)

## 👨‍💻 About

I'm Abdallah Khatib, a Computer Science graduate from Lebanese International University 🇱🇧. AceIt is my third major full-stack project, following:

- **PharmaCare** — a professional pharmacy management system with AI-powered drug interaction checking and prescription management
- **Tawla** — a multi-tenant SaaS restaurant POS with real-time Socket.io, kitchen display system, delivery management, and AI upsell suggestions

I built all three systems from scratch — database design, backend API, frontend UI, and deployment. No templates, no boilerplate, no shortcuts.
